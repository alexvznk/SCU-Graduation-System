## Santa Clara University Graduation Processing & Reporting System
By creating an electronic graduation processing and review system, students will be able to efficiently submit the information needed for their degree to be awarded, including all approvals. This will be accomplished through the following functionality:
1.	Identify and notify students who are eligible to graduate.
2.	Assist in the submission of all information necessary for students to graduate.
3.	Simplify the approval and substitution process for department administrators, advisors, and department chairs.
4.	Facilitate the review and approval processes performed by the Office of the Registrar staff.
5.	Support key stakeholders by providing the status of each approval process and general statistics.
